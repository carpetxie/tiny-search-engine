### Date: 2025.11.16

Hi everyone. 

We spent a lot of time building this. 

This was the final project for the COSC50 FA25 class Software Design and Implementation. This project is split into 3 parts: searching, indexing and quiering.

They each include their own compiling Make files with their respective cleans and tests. 

Thank you for taking the time to read/grade this. We learned a lot this term.
